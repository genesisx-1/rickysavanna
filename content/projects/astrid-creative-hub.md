I built a modular creative-collaboration hub using Next.js + TypeScript.

The architecture uses a clean division of responsibility: /app for routes and screens, /providers for global state, /lib for utilities and API logic, and /types for structured data models.

The project is built as a foundation for features like media showcasing, creator profiles, collaboration tools and a scalable asset library.

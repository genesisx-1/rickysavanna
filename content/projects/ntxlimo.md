I built a complete limo dispatch and booking system using Next.js + TypeScript.

The app uses Supabase for authentication and real-time updates so dispatchers can instantly see new bookings and driver statuses. I designed a dark, modern interface using Tailwind-style utility classes, and built custom components for the map view, booking cards, driver list, and dispatch tools.

I also integrated sound and vibration alerts for new bookings on mobile, and I organized the architecture with /app, /components, /lib, and /stores for scalable growth.

I built a lightweight chat and messaging system using Next.js + TypeScript.

The project uses custom global state via the Context API, along with a /services directory for handling login, email authentication, message operations and profile updates.

I created modular components for chat lists, message bubbles, inputs, and modals, and ensured clean deployment by resolving TypeScript build errors.

I built a multi-account trading journal designed for traders working with prop firms or multiple brokers.

The project uses a React/TypeScript structure with directories like /app, /components, /contexts, and /lib for clear separation of concerns.

It includes account management, trade inputs, account switching, analytics and dashboard components.

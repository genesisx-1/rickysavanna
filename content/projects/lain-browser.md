LAIN is a productivity workspace designed to minimize context switching by integrating essential developer tools into a single environment.

### Key Features
- **Integrated Terminal:** A real terminal docked directly below the Chromium browser window.
- **Capsules:** Save and restore entire workspaces including tabs, layouts, and AI state.
- **Focus Mode:** A deep-work suite with timers and enforcement features to boost productivity.
- **Local AI Integration:** Powered by **Ollama**, allowing for private and on-device AI interactions.
- **Cross-Tool Interaction:** Seamlessly run browser text in the terminal and interact with terminal URLs.

LAIN feels like a unified environment, bridging the gap between browsing, coding, and AI assistance.

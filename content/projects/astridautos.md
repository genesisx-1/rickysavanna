I built a full automotive customization and marketplace platform with a complete Node/Express backend and React/Next.js frontend.

The backend includes REST endpoints for managing vehicles (create, update, delete, search, filter), along with validation and improved error-logging.

On the frontend, I built the UI for vehicle galleries, customization options, search tools, and a sleek dark theme.

I also wrote the technical plan for integrating an AI chatbot using Twilio + OpenAI to help buyers communicate with dealers automatically.

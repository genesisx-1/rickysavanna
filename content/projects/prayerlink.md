I built a mobile-first prayer networking app using React Native + Expo, paired with a Node-based backend.

The mobile app includes onboarding flows, prayer posting, comment threads, messaging, notifications and account settings. I added full support/contact pages, updated the branding and bundle IDs, and prepared everything for App Store and Play Store deployment.

The backend handles posting, reactions, accounts, and mobile-ready API routes. Everything is organized cleanly with TypeScript across both the frontend and backend.

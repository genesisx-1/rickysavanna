excerpt: Attempting to deploy PhantomCloudX for the first time.

## The Attempt

I tried to deploy PhantomCloudX today. It didn't go smoothly, but I learned a lot.

## What Happened

I followed the Vercel deployment guide, connected my GitHub repository, and tried to deploy. The build failed. There were TypeScript errors I hadn't caught locally, and some import issues.

## Fixing Issues

I spent hours fixing:
- TypeScript type errors
- Missing dependencies
- Import path issues
- Build configuration problems

It was frustrating, but each fix taught me something.

## Second Attempt

After fixing the issues, I tried again. This time the build succeeded! But the app didn't work when I visited it. There were runtime errors I hadn't anticipated.

## Learning Experience

Deployment is harder than I thought. There are so many things that can go wrong, and debugging deployed applications is different from debugging locally.

## Progress

I'm closer than I was. The build works now, I just need to fix the runtime issues. I'm learning about production vs development environments and how they differ.

## Not Giving Up

I'm not giving up. I'm going to fix these issues and get PhantomCloudX deployed. This is just another learning opportunity.

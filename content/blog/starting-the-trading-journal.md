excerpt: Beginning development on my trading journal application.

## Day One

I started building the trading journal today. I set up a new React + TypeScript project and started creating the basic structure. It's exciting to finally be working on something real.

## First Steps

I created the basic component structure:
- A dashboard component
- A form to add trades
- A list to display trades
- Components for different account views

The structure is simple, but it's a start.

## What I've Built So Far

I have a basic form that can add trades. It's not pretty, but it works. I'm storing data in local storage for now, which is fine for a single-user application.

## Learning as I Go

I'm learning new things every day. Today I figured out how to properly handle form submissions in React and how to update state based on form data. Small victories, but they add up.

## Challenges

Managing the state for multiple accounts is trickier than I thought. I need to be able to switch between accounts and see different trades for each one. I'm still figuring out the best way to structure this.

## Progress

It's slow going, but I'm making progress. Every feature I add teaches me something new. This is exactly the kind of project I needed to push my skills forward.

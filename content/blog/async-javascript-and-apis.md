excerpt: Learning about promises, async/await, and working with APIs.

## New Territory

This has been the hardest topic so far. Async JavaScript is a completely different way of thinking about code execution. I've been struggling with it, but I'm starting to get it.

## Promises and Async/Await

I learned about promises first, which helped me understand the concept of asynchronous operations. Then async/await made it click. Being able to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous is pretty cool.

## Working with APIs

I built a small weather app that fetches data from an API. It was exciting to see my code communicate with an external service and display real data. The first time it worked, I was pretty pumped.

## What I'm Still Figuring Out

Error handling with async code is tricky. I'm learning about try/catch blocks and how to handle failed API requests gracefully. It's not as straightforward as I thought it would be.

## Realizations

I'm starting to see how all these pieces fit together. JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and now async operations - they're all building blocks for more complex applications.

## Moving Forward

I want to learn about React next. Everyone seems to use it, and I want to understand what the hype is about.

## Analytics Challenge

I've been working on the analytics features, and it's been challenging. Calculating win rates, profit/loss, and other metrics requires aggregating data correctly. I've had to learn about array methods like reduce and filter in more depth.

## What I've Built

I created functions to calculate:
- Total profit/loss
- Win rate percentage
- Average win/loss amounts
- Number of trades per account

These calculations update automatically when trades are added or modified.

## Dashboard Component

I built a dashboard that displays all these metrics. It's basic, but it shows the key information at a glance. Seeing the data visualized is satisfying.

## Data Structure

I've been refining my data structure as I build features. I'm learning that good data structure makes everything else easier. I've refactored the trade data model a few times already.

## Challenges

The math for calculating percentages and averages was trickier than expected. I had to handle edge cases like division by zero and empty arrays. These are the kinds of details that separate working code from good code.

## Progress Update

The application is starting to feel real. I can add trades, switch accounts, and see analytics. There's still work to do, but it's functional. I'm proud of what I've built so far.

## Next Phase

I want to add more features like trade editing and deletion, better data validation, and maybe some charts to visualize performance over time.

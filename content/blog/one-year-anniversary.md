## One Year Later

It's been exactly one year since I started this blog and my coding journey. Looking back, I can't believe how much I've learned.

## Where I Started

I began with zero knowledge of JavaScript, React, or modern web development. I was following tutorials and building simple projects, not really sure where I was going.

## Where I Am Now

I've built a complete application - PhantomCloudX. It's a multi-account trading journal that I actually use. I can build React applications, work with TypeScript, manage state, and I'm about to deploy my first project.

## What I've Learned

In one year, I've learned:
- JavaScript fundamentals
- React and component-based development
- TypeScript
- State management
- Form handling and validation
- Data persistence
- Build processes and optimization

That's a lot of ground covered.

## The Journey

It hasn't been easy. There were times I wanted to quit, times I felt stuck, times I didn't think I'd ever understand certain concepts. But I kept going, and here I am.

## What's Next

I'm going to deploy PhantomCloudX soon, then I want to start learning new things. Maybe backend development, or databases, or more advanced React patterns. The learning never stops.

## Gratitude

I'm grateful I started this blog. Documenting my journey has kept me accountable and helped me see my progress. Here's to another year of learning and building.

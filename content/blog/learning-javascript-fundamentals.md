## Progress Update

It's been three weeks since I started, and I'm making steady progress. I've been working through JavaScript fundamentals every day, and things are starting to click.

## What I've Learned So Far

I've covered:
- Variables (let, const, var and when to use each)
- Functions and arrow functions
- Arrays and array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Objects and object destructuring
- Basic DOM manipulation

The array methods were a game-changer. Understanding map, filter, and reduce opened up a whole new way of thinking about data manipulation.

## Challenges

The hardest part so far has been understanding scope and closures. I'm still wrapping my head around how variables are accessible in different contexts. But I'm getting there.

## Next Steps

I want to start building small projects to practice what I've learned. Maybe a simple todo app or a calculator. Something that forces me to use what I've been studying.

## Reflection

Learning to code is harder than I thought, but also more rewarding. Every time something clicks, it feels like unlocking a new superpower.

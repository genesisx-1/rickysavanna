## Debugging in Production

I've been learning how to debug production issues, and it's different from local development. You can't just add console.logs everywhere (well, you can, but it's not ideal).

## Tools I've Learned

I've been using:
- Browser developer tools
- Vercel's deployment logs
- Error tracking
- Network tab for API issues

These tools are essential for understanding what's happening in production.

## Issues I Fixed

I fixed several issues:
- Environment variable configuration
- Path routing problems
- CORS issues (though I'm not using APIs yet)
- Build optimization problems

Each fix made me understand deployment better.

## Lessons Learned

I've learned:
- Test your build locally before deploying
- Check browser console for errors
- Read deployment logs carefully
- Production and development can behave differently

## Progress

PhantomCloudX is getting closer to working in production. I've fixed most of the issues, and I'm confident I can get it fully working soon.

## Next Attempt

I'm going to try deploying again this week. I think I've fixed the major issues, and I'm ready to try again. Fingers crossed this time it works!

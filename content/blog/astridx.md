## Keeping It Simple

For the Astrid Genesis brand website, I wanted to keep things simple and fast. The goal was a clean, minimal design that loaded instantly and looked professional.

## Technology Choice

I chose Vite for the build system, which provides lightning-fast development and optimized production builds. For simpler pages, I used plain HTML/JS to keep the bundle size minimal.

## Routing and Navigation

I implemented a simple routing system that worked seamlessly with the static hosting setup. The navigation needed to be smooth and intuitive, with branded sections that clearly communicated the brand's identity.

## Design Process

The design process focused on whitespace, typography, and clear hierarchy. I removed everything that wasn't essential, leaving only what was needed to communicate the brand effectively.

## Deployment Configuration

I configured netlify.toml for smooth deployment and fast static hosting. This ensured the site would load quickly for visitors regardless of their location.

## Final Touches

The site features a global footer, consistent branding throughout, and a focus on performance. Every element was chosen to support fast loading and a clean user experience.

## Results

The minimal approach paid off - the site loads almost instantly and provides a clean, professional representation of the Astrid Genesis brand without any unnecessary complexity.

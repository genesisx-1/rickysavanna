## Why TypeScript?

I kept seeing TypeScript mentioned everywhere, and I wanted to understand what it was. After some research, I realized it's JavaScript with types, which helps catch errors before they happen. That sounded useful.

## First Impressions

TypeScript is JavaScript, but stricter. At first, it felt annoying having to define types for everything, but I'm starting to see the benefits. My code feels more robust.

## What I've Learned

I've been working through TypeScript basics:
- Type annotations
- Interfaces
- Type inference
- Union types

Interfaces are particularly useful for defining the shape of objects. It's like having a contract for your data.

## Converting JavaScript to TypeScript

I've been converting some of my JavaScript projects to TypeScript. It's tedious, but it's good practice. The type errors are actually helpful - they're catching bugs I didn't know existed.

## Challenges

The learning curve is steeper than I expected. Some of the advanced types are confusing, but I'm taking it slow and focusing on the basics first.

## Why This Matters

I want to build professional applications, and TypeScript seems to be the standard for larger projects. Learning it now will pay off later.

## Next Steps

I'm going to continue practicing TypeScript while I plan out my trading journal project. I want to build it with TypeScript from the start.

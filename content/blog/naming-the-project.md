excerpt: Finalizing the trading journal and giving it a name.

## Project Name

I've decided to call it PhantomCloudX. It's a multi-account trading journal, and I think the name fits. It sounds professional and memorable.

## Final Features

I've been adding the final touches:
- Better styling and UI polish
- Improved data validation
- Error messages and user feedback
- Code cleanup and documentation

I want this to be something I can be proud of.

## What I've Accomplished

Looking back, I've built:
- A complete React + TypeScript application
- Account management system
- Trade tracking and editing
- Analytics dashboard
- Data persistence

For my first real project, I'm pretty happy with it.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me:
- How to plan and execute a larger project
- The importance of code organization
- How to solve problems I didn't know how to solve
- That building real projects is the best way to learn

## Next Steps

I'm going to finish polishing PhantomCloudX, then I want to learn about deployment. I'd like to put this online so others can use it too.

## Reflection

It's been almost a year since I started learning to code. I've gone from knowing nothing to building a complete application. The progress feels real now.

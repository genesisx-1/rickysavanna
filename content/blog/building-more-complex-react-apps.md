excerpt: Learning about state management and building apps with multiple components.

## Leveling Up

I've been building more complex React applications, and I'm starting to see the real power of the framework. Managing multiple components that need to share state is challenging but rewarding.

## What I've Learned

I've been working with:
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Lifting state up
- Passing callbacks between components
- Conditional rendering

The useEffect hook was confusing at first, but now I understand how to use it for side effects like API calls and subscriptions.

## Project I'm Working On

I'm building a note-taking app with React. It has multiple components, manages state, and uses local storage to persist data. It's not perfect, but it's teaching me a lot about React patterns.

## Struggles

Managing state across multiple components is getting complicated. I'm passing props down multiple levels, and it's starting to feel messy. I've heard about Context API and state management libraries, but I want to understand the basics first.

## Realizations

I'm starting to think about building something real - a project that solves an actual problem. I have an idea brewing, but I need to learn more first.

## What's Next

I want to learn about routing in React and how to build multi-page applications. Then maybe I'll be ready to start that project I've been thinking about.

## Why React?

After building a few vanilla JavaScript projects, I can see why people use frameworks. Managing state and updating the DOM manually is getting tedious. React seems like it will solve a lot of those problems.

## First Impressions

React is different. The component-based approach makes sense, but JSX threw me for a loop at first. Writing HTML in JavaScript felt weird, but I'm getting used to it.

## What I've Built

I've been working through the React documentation and building small components. A button component, a card component, a simple form. Nothing complex, but I'm learning the patterns.

## State and Props

Understanding state and props was a breakthrough moment. The idea that components can be reusable and receive data through props is powerful. And useState makes managing component state so much easier than vanilla JavaScript.

## Challenges

The hardest part is understanding when to create new components and when to keep things together. I'm still figuring out component composition and how to structure my code.

## Next Steps

I want to build a more complex React app. Maybe something with multiple components that share state. That's the next challenge.

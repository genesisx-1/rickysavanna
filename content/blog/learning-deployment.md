## New Territory

I've been learning about deployment, and it's a whole new world. There's so much to understand: hosting, domains, build processes, environment variables. It's overwhelming but exciting.

## What I've Learned

I've been researching:
- Different hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Railway)
- Build processes and optimization
- Environment variables and configuration
- Domain setup

Vercel seems popular for React apps, so I'm leaning toward that.

## Preparing for Deployment

I've been optimizing my code for production:
- Removing console.logs
- Adding error boundaries
- Optimizing bundle size
- Testing everything one more time

I want to make sure it works well when deployed.

## Challenges

Understanding the deployment process is confusing. There are so many steps and things that can go wrong. But I'm learning, and I'll figure it out.

## Goal

I want to deploy PhantomCloudX by the end of the year. That's my goal. Having it live on the internet will make it feel real in a way it doesn't right now.

## Progress

I'm close to being ready. Just a few more things to polish, and then I'll attempt my first deployment. Wish me luck!

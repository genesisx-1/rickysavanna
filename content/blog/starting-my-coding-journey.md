## Why I'm Starting This Blog

I've decided to start learning web development seriously, and I want to document my journey. This blog will serve as a way to track my progress, reflect on what I'm learning, and hopefully help others who are on a similar path.

## Where I'm Starting

I have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, but I'm essentially starting from scratch when it comes to JavaScript and modern web development. My goal is to build real projects that solve real problems.

## My Plan

I'm going to commit to learning consistently and documenting my progress every few weeks. I want to see how far I can go in a year, and this blog will be my record of that journey.

## First Steps

I'm starting with JavaScript fundamentals - variables, functions, arrays, objects. The basics that everything else builds on. It's a bit overwhelming seeing how much there is to learn, but I'm excited to dive in.

Let's see where this takes me.

## Build Process

I've been learning about the build process for React applications. There's a lot that happens when you run `npm run build`:
- Code transpilation
- Bundling and minification
- Asset optimization
- Tree shaking

Understanding this process helps me write better code.

## Optimization

I've been optimizing my code:
- Removing unused imports
- Splitting code into smaller chunks
- Optimizing images and assets
- Reducing bundle size

Every kilobyte matters when it comes to load times.

## Environment Variables

I learned about environment variables and how to use them for configuration. This is important for deployment - you don't want to hardcode API keys or URLs.

## Challenges

The build process can be confusing. Sometimes builds fail for reasons that aren't obvious. I've learned to read error messages carefully and use build tools to identify issues.

## Getting Closer

I'm getting closer to deployment. I understand the process better now, and I'm more confident about what I need to do. The technical side is less intimidating than it was a few weeks ago.

## Next Steps

I'm going to do a test deployment soon. I want to see the process in action before I deploy the real thing. Practice makes perfect, right?

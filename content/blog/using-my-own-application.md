excerpt: Actually using PhantomCloudX for my trading and finding areas to improve.

## Real-World Usage

I've been using PhantomCloudX for my actual trading, and it's been eye-opening. Using something you built reveals issues you never noticed during development.

## Issues I've Found

I've discovered:
- Some UI elements that aren't intuitive
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Missing features I wish I had
- Bugs that only appear with real usage

This is valuable feedback, even if it's just from me.

## Improvements Made

I've been making improvements:
- Better data validation
- Improved UI/UX
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes

It's satisfying to improve something based on real usage.

## What I've Learned

Building something and using it daily teaches you:
- What features actually matter
- What can be improved
- How users (even if it's just you) interact with your app
- The difference between "it works" and "it works well"

## Iteration

I'm learning that software development is iterative. You build, use, improve, repeat. PhantomCloudX is better now than when I first deployed it, and it will be better in the future.

## Next Project

I'm starting to think about my next project. I have ideas, but I want to finish polishing PhantomCloudX first. I want it to be really good before I move on.

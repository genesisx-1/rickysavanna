## New Skills

I've been learning React Router, and it's opening up new possibilities. Being able to create multi-page applications with React is a game-changer.

## What I've Built

I created a simple multi-page app with navigation. It has a home page, an about page, and a contact page. Nothing fancy, but it works! The routing makes it feel like a real application.

## Key Concepts

I've learned about:
- BrowserRouter and Routes
- Link and NavLink components
- useNavigate hook
- Route parameters

Route parameters were particularly interesting - being able to pass data through URLs is powerful.

## Project Ideas

I'm getting closer to starting a real project. I have an idea for a trading journal application. I trade stocks as a hobby, and I've been tracking my trades in spreadsheets. A web app would be so much better.

## What I Need to Learn

Before I can build it, I need to learn:
- How to structure a larger React application
- State management (maybe Context API or Redux)
- Working with forms and validation
- Styling (I've been using basic CSS, but I should learn something better)

## Progress Check

It's been about 5 months since I started, and I've learned a lot. I can build basic React applications now, which feels like a huge accomplishment. But I know there's still so much more to learn.

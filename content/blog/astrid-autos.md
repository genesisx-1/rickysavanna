## Starting the Project

I began working on Astrid Autos with the goal of creating a full-featured automotive marketplace where buyers could customize vehicles and connect with dealers. The initial challenge was designing a system that could handle both the marketplace functionality and the customization features seamlessly.

## Backend Development

The first phase focused on building a robust Node/Express backend. I created REST endpoints for all vehicle operations - create, update, delete, search, and filter. This required careful planning of the database schema to support complex queries and filtering options.

I spent time implementing proper validation and error-logging to ensure the API was reliable and easy to debug. This proved crucial when handling edge cases with vehicle data and user inputs.

## Frontend Implementation

With the backend in place, I moved to the React/Next.js frontend. I built out the vehicle galleries with smooth image loading and pagination. The customization options required a flexible UI that could handle different vehicle types and their specific customization parameters.

I implemented a sleek dark theme throughout the application, which required careful attention to color schemes and contrast for readability. The search tools needed to be fast and intuitive, so I optimized the filtering logic and added real-time search suggestions.

## AI Chatbot Integration

One of the most interesting parts was planning the AI chatbot integration. I wrote a technical plan for using Twilio + OpenAI to enable automated communication between buyers and dealers. This would allow buyers to ask questions about vehicles 24/7, and dealers could respond or have the AI handle common inquiries automatically.

The integration required careful API design to ensure the chatbot could access vehicle data and provide accurate information to potential buyers.

## Final Steps

After thorough testing and refinement, I deployed the platform. The combination of a solid backend, intuitive frontend, and planned AI integration created a comprehensive solution for the automotive marketplace space.

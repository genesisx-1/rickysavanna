excerpt: Starting to plan a trading journal application - my first real project.

## The Idea

I've been trading stocks as a hobby, and I track everything in spreadsheets. It works, but it's not ideal. I want to build a web application that makes it easier to track trades, analyze performance, and manage multiple accounts.

## Why This Project?

This solves a real problem I have. I'm not just building something to learn - I'm building something I'll actually use. That motivation is different from my previous projects.

## Planning Phase

I've been sketching out what the application needs:
- Ability to add and edit trades
- Track multiple trading accounts
- Basic analytics (win rate, profit/loss)
- Simple dashboard to see performance

It's not going to be fancy, but it needs to work well.

## Technology Stack

I'm planning to use:
- React with TypeScript
- Local storage for data persistence (to start)
- CSS for styling (maybe I'll learn Tailwind)

I want to keep it simple for my first real project.

## Challenges Ahead

I know this will be harder than anything I've built before. Managing state, handling forms, calculating analytics - there's a lot to figure out. But I'm excited to try.

## Timeline

I'm giving myself a few months to build this. I want to take my time and do it right. This is my first real project, and I want to be proud of it.

excerpt: Exploring mobile AI functionality with an AI-powered translation app built in React Native.
---

## Early Exploration

LangAI was a project exploring mobile AI functionality. I wanted to build something that demonstrated how AI could be useful in a mobile context, and translation seemed like a perfect use case.

## Choosing React Native + Expo

I chose React Native with Expo for rapid development. Expo made it easy to test on real devices and handle the build process without dealing with native code complexity.

## App Modes

I designed the app with two modes: simple and complex. The simple mode was for quick translations, while the complex mode offered more options and settings. This gave users flexibility based on their needs.

## Environment Variables

I implemented environment-variable support so the app could be configured for different environments without code changes. This made testing and development much smoother.

## Screen Organization

The UI needed to be clean and intuitive. I organized the screens for language input, translation output, and history in a way that made the workflow natural. The history feature was particularly useful for users who needed to reference previous translations.

## Learning Experience

I never deployed LangAI to production, but it was an important learning experience. It taught me about mobile development, AI integration, and building user-friendly interfaces for AI-powered features. The project is archived, but the experience was valuable for understanding how to approach mobile AI applications.

## Looking Forward

The lessons from LangAI informed my later mobile projects, particularly around how to structure mobile apps and integrate AI features in a way that feels natural to users.

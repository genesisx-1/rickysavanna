excerpt: Adding polish and new features to make the application more complete.

## Feature Additions

I've been adding features that make the application more complete:
- Edit and delete trades
- Form validation
- Better error handling
- Improved UI feedback

These might seem like small things, but they make a huge difference in how the app feels to use.

## Form Validation

I learned about form validation in React. It's important to validate user input before it's saved. I'm checking for required fields, valid numbers, and reasonable date ranges.

## Code Organization

I've been refactoring my code to be more organized. I created separate files for utility functions, types, and constants. The codebase is getting larger, and organization matters.

## What I've Learned

This project has taught me:
- How to structure a larger React application
- State management with Context API
- Form handling and validation
- Data persistence with local storage
- Basic analytics and calculations

I've come a long way from my first todo app.

## Challenges

The hardest part has been keeping everything organized as the project grows. I'm learning that good code structure is just as important as working code.

## Almost There

I'm getting close to having a complete application. There are still some features I want to add, but the core functionality is there. I'm excited to finish this and move on to the next project.
